    <h2>Post 073018a: OSPL 0.0a LTS prototypes coming very soon</h2>
	<p>The OSPL specification is out of drafting, and the final specification will be coming soon. Barebone prototypes of the specification, compiler, and OSPL-ioutils will be coming very soon.</p>

	<h2>Post 073118a: XOSPL specification coming within the coming days for the 0.0a specification!</h2>
	<p>XOSPL will be a medium between the raw language and compiler. Although there are plans in place to remove this later, it will be a good insight into how the compiler will input and output data in case you want to make your own compiler considering the direct-to-Java system would be both a pain to develop (also DOM isn't that hard).</p>

	<h2>Post 073118b: How to contribute code to OSPL</h2>
	<p>Let's say you develop in languages like Kotlin, Fortran, Scala, etc. You learn about a new language called "OSPL" that you would very much like to use in your next project. However, to your dismay, you learn that the only currently planned official integrations for OSPL are Java, C, C#, C++, and Ruby (Rails integration is planned too for all of the web developers). What do you do? Simply fork this repo and edit the output for your own language. Considering that OSPL is open source and licensed with the GNU GPL 3.0, you can just fork it, edit <code>translateOutput.java</code>, and then OSPL works for your language. You can also improve or port my code with the port function. If you port OSPL and your port is good enough, it may be included on the future omni-systems.technology website as official software!</p>

	<p>I finished the XOSPL preview much ahead of schedule. it will be located in the xospl folder, as pre-0.0a-073118.xml. The full version should be coming in the next days.</p>
